<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kunfel Tenzin Gyapatsang and I am 28 years young.
  Originally I am from Tibet but grew up in India, where I lived in an exile home for around 8 years.
  When I was 12, I came to Switzerland and after a long time I was able to finally meet my mother again.</p>

<p>Here in Switzerland I completed school and an apprenticeship.
  I also completed the Swiss military service. Through this I learned to become more disciplined and self-confident.</p>

<p>At my current work I work with various computer applications. I enrolled in the bootcamp course on udemy to expand my knowledge of web development.
  I am happy to take this new step and I am excited to see what kind of new things will cross my way.</p>
